title: Starting out at Bloc
---
My experience at bloc all started really fast, I was unhappy with my job and just needed to find a career I would be happy with. Traditional college just never appealed to me, I like to work at my own pace, not be rushed past subjects that is harder for me to grasp and retain. I grew up with computers, at age 4 I was playing games and learning how the internet worked back in 1999. I knew programming would be the thing that I would enjoy the most. So I looked into coding boot camps and Bloc stood out to me, I had enough money saved to pay the first year of the fees no problem and my current boss was okay with me transitioning from full time to part time.

It took me about 3 days after thinking of programming as a career before I signed up for classes for the following week. The first week you have to talk to your mentor and get a feel for each other and my mentor and I talked for a few hours even though the meeting was scheduled for 30 minutes. I was definitely feeling happy with my decision to do this, the starting modules were a breeze for me. Html was no big deal since I was familiar with it, I just had to get used to formatting everything to be easily readable for others.

Then came the JavaScript module, it was the first time I was learning something that I didn't just pick up no problem. Memorizing the syntax of everything and understand how it will read my code if I place this block of code above a particular function or variable. It took me a good 2 1/2 weeks of playing around with codewars, the bloc module lessons, and reading the references for almost 4-6 hours a day. But my hard work paid off and eventually it clicked.

(insert funny picture of trying hard)
